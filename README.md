# Bayes-Theorem-Min-Error-Rate-Classifier-Application-for-Computer-Vision
This project focuses on creating and analyzing a custom dataset for a two-class classification problem. Gaussian-based class conditional density functions and  Naive Bayes methods are used to model the data, and I utilized decision boundaries to evaluate accuracy and alignment with the manual predictions.
